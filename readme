I find myself simplifying operations quite frequently.
 Making Helper classes and such.

 This library may serve any of:
 1) simplifing operations that take 20-30 lines to perform down to 1 - 5.
 2) finding ways to be more efficient. (caching when possible, wrapping a optomized algo.)
 3) interesting helpful classes. (in general)
